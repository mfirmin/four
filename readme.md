four
====

### Description 

_four_ is designed to be an all-in-one rendering and rigid body physics simulation engine. 
It is essentially a wrapper for OpenGL, GLFW, and the simulation engine Open Dynamics Engine.

_four_ is the very beginning of my attempt at crowd sourcing my 
[Master's Thesis](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mfirmin/research.php) work.

### Dependencies

* OpenGL

* GLFW3 - http://www.glfw.org/

* ODE - http://www.ode.org/

### Usage

From the root directory, run make. This will place the executable world in the bin directory. 
It has been tested on and should work on OSX Yosemite and Linux Mint.

To run, type bin/world. Play around with adding entities and joints in simpleWorld.cpp
